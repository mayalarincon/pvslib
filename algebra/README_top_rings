%%%%%% Rings: Formalization of some results on ring theory %%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  The theory rings contains results on ring theory such as the
%  three isomorphism theorems, binomial theorem, theorems
%  on maximal, prime and principal ideals, a general version for
%  rings of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), factorization on 
%  commutative rings, formalization of Unique Factorization Domains,
%  a general version of Euclidean gcd algorithm for Euclidean Domais.
%  An interesting feature of this formalization of CRT for rings is
%  that it does not require commutativity being proved just for rings
%  with identity.
%  The theory rings also includes a numerical version of the CRT
%  for the ring of integers, which is the restricted version of CRT
%  mechanically formalized. CRT for integers is proved parameterizing
%  the general version of CRT for rings.
%  Also, the correctness of the Euclidean gcd algorithm for the rings
%  of integers and Gaussian integers were established by parameterizing
%  the theorem concerning the correctness of the Euclidean gcd
%  algorithm for Euclidean Domains.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Requirements
---------------

a. Make sure PVS 7.1.0 (Allegro) has been installed. 
   Available at: http://www.csl.sri.com/users/owre/drop/pvs-snapshots/
   For installation see the INSTALL and README files of the PVS distribution.

b. This theory requires NASA Langley PVS Libraries which are available at: 
     https://github.com/nasa/pvslib/tree/pvs7.0
   These libraries should be included.
   The NASA Langley PVS Libraries should be downloaded and copied in a subdirectory
   nasalib in the folder in which the pvs distribution has been downloaded/installed.
   See README file of the NASA Langley PVS Libraries. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Some instructions on the use of PVS
--------------------------------------
PVS on VSCode. Documentation and tutorials about the use of PVS integrated with
VSCode is available at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paolomasci.vscode-pvs 

PVS on Emacs.  When you run the command "pvs" it will open emacs in which
immediately the PVS Welcome windows will be open.

You should open the .pvs file you want to check:  for instance top_rings.pvs.
For doing this you can use the emacs menu or the shortcut: <ctr-x> <ctl-f> or
<ALT+x> <ff>.

An important detail is that in PVS you should select as 'context' the folder in which
the files are stored. So, if you run the "pvs" command in a different folder from the
one your stored files, the first thing you need to do is to change the context,
which is done executing the command <ALT+x> <change-context>   or simply  <ALT+x> <cc>

Once the file is open move the cursor to the lemma, corollary or theorem you want
to check.  After you select the desired formula, you can run its proof by executing
the command prove or x-prove.  If you want to see the proof step by step use the
command step-proof or x-step-proof. The commands with prefix "x" also show the proof
tree. For instance, you can execute the commands <ALT-x> <prove>, or <ALT-x> <x-prove>.
The former will run the proof and the latter will do the same, but showing the
proof tree. Also, you can execute the command <ALT-x> <show-proof> to see the
proof without executing it.

If you want to check the whole theory algebra, open the top.pvs file and run the
command <ALT-x> <prove-importchain>; if you want to check the theory fields,
run the same command after open the file top_fields.pvs.  To prove a subtheory
separately, you can run the command <ALT-x> <prove-theory>.

In PVS the proofs are stored in the corresponding .prf files, but you only need to
open and edit the .pvs specification files.
